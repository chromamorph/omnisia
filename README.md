# OMNISIA and MaxTranPats

This repository contains the source code and executable JAR files for a Java system that implements a variety of algorithms and computational techniques for pattern matching, pattern discovery, data compression and analysis in multi-dimensional point sets. The functionality of the system is accessible through two programs, [OMNISIA][1] and [MaxTranPats][2], both of which are JAR files that can be run from the console on any system that can run Java programs. MaxTranPats can be used to process point sets with any number of dimensions, while OMNISIA is tailored to processing 2-dimensional pitch--vs.--time representations of music.

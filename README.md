# OMNISIA and MaxTranPats
## Version 20251128
This repository contains the source code and executable JAR files for a Java system that implements a variety of algorithms and computational techniques for pattern matching, pattern discovery, data compression and analysis in multi-dimensional point sets. The functionality of the system is accessible through two programs, [OMNISIA](https://github.com/chromamorph/omnisia/blob/dab916d8fcdc6c023bca14d55eb8c01d0ca6f1c2/Points/jars/omnisia20251128.jar) and [MaxTranPats](https://github.com/chromamorph/omnisia/blob/fa897dbd91d66fba83a78afb896d871430548907/MaxTranPatsJava/jars/maxtranpats20251128.jar), both of which are JAR files that can be run from the console on any system that has an up-to-date Java Runtime Environment installed. MaxTranPats can be used to process point sets with any number of dimensions, while OMNISIA is tailored to processing 2-dimensional pitch-time representations of music. The code is open-source, free software, released under a [GPL 3.0 licence](https://github.com/chromamorph/omnisia/tree/master?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file).

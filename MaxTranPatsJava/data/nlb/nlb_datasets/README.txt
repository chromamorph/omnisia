There is a small corpus (The Annotated Corpus) consisting of 360 melodies, denoted with 'ann', and a large corpus consisting of 4830 melodies, denoted with 'all'. The melodies in the annotated corpus are also included in the large corpus.

Tune family labels are provided in files 'all-labels.txt' and 'ann-labels.txt'. Character encoding of labels is UTF-8.

Encoding of filenames is as follows: NLBxxxxxx_yy

NLB : Nederlandse Liederenbank (Database of Dutch Songs)
xxxxxx : recordnumber of the song
yy : stanza 

The reference melodies are those melodies from the annotated corpus that are considered the best example for their respective tune family by the collection specialists of the Meertens Institute. See: Volk, A. & P. van Kranenburg. (2012) 'Melodic similarity among folk songs: An annotation study on similarity-based categorization in music'. In: Musicae Scientiae: 16 (3), 317-339.

Metadata belonging to a song can be found by entering the recordnumber as query in the search field of the NLB:

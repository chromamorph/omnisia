We assume we have set up a directory, <root>, to hold all the output data

1. Generate compressed versions of all the annotated files. This is done using 

com.chromamorph.points018.RunMeNLB.java

These compressed files get stored in a directory

<root>/<algorithm>/NLB

where <algorithm> is the name of this algorithm.

2. Generated compressed versions of all pairs of annotated files. This is done using

com.chromamorph.points.018.RunMeNLBPairs.java

The compressed files are stored in a folder called

<root>/<algorithm>/NLB-PAIRS


3. Calculate the NCD between each pair of songs. This is done using

com.chromamorph.points018.NLBNCD.java

The distances are stored in a file called

<root>/<algorithm>/distances.txt

4. Compute the family for each song and the success rate for 1-nn and leave-one-out cross validation. This is done using the file

com.chromamorph.points018.JNMR2014Evaluation.java

It automatically generates a results table at the location where you ask it to (defined in nlbResultsTableTexFilePath).

\begin{abstract}
SIATEC computes the translational equivalence class (TEC) of each
maximal translatable pattern (MTP) in its input point set, $D$. In the
output of SIATEC, each TEC is encoded as a pair, $\langle P,
T\rangle$, in which $P$ is an MTP and $T$ is a set of vectors
(``translators") that map $P$ onto its occurrences in $D$. Several
algorithms have been proposed for selecting a subset of the TECs
computed by SIATEC that efficiently covers the input point set,
$D$. These TEC cover algorithms adopt various greedy strategies that
prefer TECs with high compression factors. Two novel techniques are
presented here to improve the compression factor achieved using TEC
cover algorithms.  First, an algorithm, RecurSIA, is presented, that
recursively applies a selected TEC cover algorithm to the pattern,
$P$, in each TEC. Second, a technique is presented tha

which takes a point set, $D$, and a TEC covering algorithm, $A$, as
its arguments.  RecurSIA first applies $A$ to $D$, which outputs a set
of TECs, $S$. Each TEC in $S$ is a pair, $\langle P,T\rangle$, where
$P$ is a pattern and $T$ is a set of translators. RecurSIA applies
itself to the pattern, $P$, in each TEC in $S$, which typically
results in a more compressed encoding of each pattern $P$. The second
compression-enhancement technique presented here involves pruning
redundant translators from the set, $T$, in each TEC in the computed
cover. A translator, $v\in T$, is considered redundant if it can be
removed from $T$ without changing the covered set of $T$. Ideally, we
would want to find for each $T$, one of the smallest subsets of $T$
such that the covered set is the same as that for the full
$T$. However, this is an NP-hard problem. An efficient approximation
algorithm is proposed that typically gives a good solution.

The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in
150--250 words.

\section{First Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

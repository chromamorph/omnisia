SIATEC computes the translational equivalence class (TEC) of each
maximal translatable pattern (MTP) in its input point set, $D$. In the
output of SIATEC, each TEC is encoded as a pair, $\langle P,
T\rangle$, in which $P$ is an MTP and $T$ is a set of vectors
(``translators") that map $P$ onto its occurrences in $D$. Several
algorithms have been proposed for selecting a subset of the TECs
computed by SIATEC that efficiently covers the input point set,
$D$. These TEC cover algorithms adopt various greedy strategies that
prefer TECs with high compression factors. Two novel techniques are
presented here to improve the compression factor achieved using TEC
cover algorithms.  First, an algorithm, RecurSIA, is presented, that
recursively applies a selected TEC cover algorithm to the pattern,
$P$, in each TEC. Second, a technique is presented tha

which takes a point set, $D$, and a TEC covering algorithm,
$A$,  as its  arguments.  RecurSIA  first  applies $A$  to $D$,  which
outputs  a set  of TECs,  $S$. Each  TEC in  $S$ is  a pair,  $\langle
P,T\rangle$,  where   $P$  is  a   pattern  and   $T$  is  a   set  of
translators. RecurSIA applies itself to  the pattern, $P$, in each TEC
in $S$, which typically results in a more compressed encoding of each pattern $P$. The second compression-enhancement technique presented here involves pruning redundant translators from the set, $T$, in each TEC in the computed cover. A translator, $v\in T$, is considered redundant if it can be removed from $T$ without changing the covered set of $T$. Ideally, we would want to find for each $T$, one of the smallest subsets of $T$ such that the covered set is the same as that for the full $T$. However, this is an NP-hard problem. An efficient approximation algorithm is proposed that typically gives a good solution.
